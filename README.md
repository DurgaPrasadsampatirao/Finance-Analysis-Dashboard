## Key Objectives
1. **Financial Data Consolidation**: Integrate data from multiple financial sources, including balance sheets, profit and loss statements, and cash flow reports.
2. **Data Visualization**: Use various chart types such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to present financial data clearly.
3. **Cash Flow Analysis**: Analyze cash flow trends to identify areas of concern and ensure liquidity.
4. **Profitability Analysis**: Track profit margins, gross profit, and net income to assess the company’s financial health.
5. **Financial Forecasting**: Create models to forecast future financial performance based on historical trends and assumptions.

## Insights and Findings

### 1. Data Overview
- **Data Sources**: The dataset includes historical financial statements such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - `Revenue`: Total sales or income earned by the company.
  - `Expenses`: Costs incurred by the company in operations, including administrative expenses, COGS, and interest.
  - `Gross Profit`: The difference between revenue and the cost of goods sold (COGS).
  - `Net Profit`: The profit after all expenses, taxes, and interest are deducted.
  - `Cash Flow`: The movement of cash into and out of the company, including operating, investing, and financing cash flows.

### 2. Data Visualization Techniques
- **Bar Charts**: Used to compare revenues, expenses, and profits across different periods (monthly, quarterly, annually).
- **Pie Charts**: To show the distribution of expenses or revenue across categories (e.g., revenue by region or product line).
- **Line Graphs**: To track key financial metrics over time, such as cash flow trends or profit margins.
- **Heatmaps**: To analyze correlations between different financial metrics and highlight areas for improvement.

### 3. Financial Ratios and Metrics
- **Gross Profit Margin**: Calculated as (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 to assess the efficiency of production.
- **Operating Profit Margin**: Calculated as (Operating Profit / Revenue) * 100 to analyze core business profitability.
- **Net Profit Margin**: Calculated as (Net Profit / Revenue) * 100 to evaluate overall profitability.
- **Return on Assets (ROA)**: Analyzes the company’s ability to generate profit from assets.
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Evaluates the return generated on shareholders' equity.

### 4. Forecasting and Projections
- **Financial Projections**: The dashboard allows for the projection of revenue, expenses, and profits based on historical growth rates and assumptions.
- **Scenario Analysis**: Users can adjust inputs (e.g., revenue growth rate, expense ratio) to see how different scenarios affect the company’s financial future.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset is collected from various financial statements, including internal reports and external sources.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Missing values were handled through imputation, and data was standardized for consistency.
3. **Data Analysis**: Key financial ratios and metrics were calculated to provide insights into the company’s financial health.
4. **Dashboard Design**: The dashboard was designed using Power BI/Tableau, featuring interactive filters for user-driven analysis and visualization.
5. **Forecasting Model**: A forecasting model was built using linear regression and time series analysis techniques to predict future financial performance.
